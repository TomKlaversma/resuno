# Brand Vision & Technical Briefing: RESUNO

## 1. Executive Summary

**Resuno** is a high-end AI Architecture Agency for SMEs (MKB) and Startups. We bridge the gap between "messy AI experiments" (houtje-touwtje) and "production-grade, scalable operations." Our core philosophy is **Resonance**: amplifying human intelligence through a perfectly orchestrated AI stack.

* **Founder:** Tom
* **Target Market:** The Netherlands (SMEs and Tech Startups)
* **Core Promise:** Scaling momentum while ensuring data security and architectural integrity.
* **Website Language:** Dutch (Nederlands)

---

## 2. Visual Concept: "The Echo of Tom"

The website must visually represent the "Multi-Tom" capability.

* **The Hero Image:** A high-quality professional photo of Tom. Behind him, 3-4 "Echoes" (semi-transparent silhouettes or versions of the same photo with decreasing opacity) fan out.
* **The Metaphor:** One architect (Tom) orchestrating a fleet of specialized AI capabilities (The Echoes).
* **Interactivity:** Hovering over an "Echo" should reveal its specific function (e.g., *Echo 01: Security*, *Echo 02: Rapid Prototyping*, *Echo 03: API Orchestration*).

---

## 3. Brand Tone & Voice

* **Direct & No-nonsense:** Typical Dutch "MKB-mentaliteit."
* **High-Tech but Approachable:** Avoid jargon-heavy "Silicon Valley" talk. Use terms like "Volwassen architectuur" instead of "Enterprise-grade."
* **Authoritative:** Moving from a "Developer for hire" to an "Architect of Systems."

---

## 4. Product Offerings (The Tiers)

### **Pakket A: De Resuno Scan (€ 2.000,-)**

* **Goal:** Direct momentum and audit.
* **Format:** 2 days on-site.
  * Day 1: Audit of tool-overload and team interviews.
  * Day 2: Implementation of 3 "Quick Wins" + Architectural Roadmap.

### **Pakket B: De Foundation Build (Project-based)**

* **Goal:** Building the Core-stack.
* **Features:** Consolidating 20+ tools into a core set, Private LLM setups (Azure/Cloudflare), and secure data flows.

### **Pakket C: Custom AI Development (Equity/Hybrid)**

* **Goal:** Strategic partnership for startups.
* **Focus:** Building unique moats and scalable software from the ground up (no plugins/wrappers).

---

## 5. Technical Requirements for Developers

### **Front-end Stack Preference**

* **Framework:** Next.js or React (Vercel deployment).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Modern, clean, "SaaS" aesthetic).
* **Animations:** Framer Motion for the "Echo" effect and smooth transitions.

### **Key Messaging (Dutch Copywriting Examples)**

* **Headline:** "Van AI-chaos naar schaalbaar momentum."
* **Sub-headline:** "Wij bouwen de architectuur die jouw team versterkt. Veilig, volwassen en zonder houtje-touwtje oplossingen."
* **The "Moat" Argument:** "Technische kennis is geen drempel meer. De winst zit in de unieke dataflow en een volwassen systeem."

### **SEO & Keywords**

* **Primary:** AI Architect, AI Implementatie MKB, Private LLM opzetten, Data Security Audit.
* **Secondary:** Houtje-touwtje AI fixen, AI voor startups Nederland.

## 6. Development Instructions (Agent-specific)

1. **Layout:** Use a bento-grid style for the services section to emphasize the "Core-stack" feeling.
2. **Hero Section:** Create a container that can handle the "Echo" image effect. The original image should be the focal point, with 3 SVG-filtered or opacity-reduced clones layered behind it.
3. **Trust Signals:** Include a section for "Case Studies" (Startups & MKB) and a "Work with Tom" CTA.
4. **Conversion:** A simple, high-friction lead form (to filter quality) for the "Resuno Scan."

---

## 7. Strategic Nuance

While the website emphasizes **Speed** and **Growth**, the USP is **Security**. Use "Security as a guardrail for speed" (Veiligheid als vangrail voor snelheid). Emphasize that we don't just "glue plugins together"; we build scalable software using Laravel, TypeScript, and Cloudflare.

---

## 8. Brand Philosophy: Resonance

The name "Resuno" combines:
* **Re-** (back, again, renewal)
* **-sono** (sound, resonance in Latin/Italian)

This represents the core philosophy: **amplifying and echoing human intelligence** through AI architecture. We create systems that resonate with your business goals, amplifying your team's capabilities rather than replacing them.
